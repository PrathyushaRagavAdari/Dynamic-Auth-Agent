# Week 4 Integration Brief — GraphGuard Identity Agent
**Team:** Dynamic Agnets  
**Stakeholder/User:** Bank Compliance Auditor  
**Problem:** Replacing insecure static security questions and high-friction MFA with dynamic, context-aware identity verification challenges based on transaction history.

## 1) Module placement in capstone system
- Upstream inputs: Proposed security question templates generated by the core GraphGuard Agent (e.g., What specific merchant did you visit?),NIST SP 800-63B guidelines (PDF) and visual AAL requirement tables, Queries from internal Risk/Compliance Officers.
- Module responsibilities: Serve as the Governance Layer to audit dynamic questions before they reach users, Enforce Hallucination-Free grounding by refusing non-compliant or out-of-scope queries.
- Downstream outputs: A Compliant/Non-Compliant verdict with specific citations (e.g., NIST 800-63B, Table 5-1), Logs of the audit decision for regulatory reporting.

## 2) User workflow (end-to-end)
1.Submission: A Compliance Officer uses the Streamlit dashboard to input a new dynamic question type (e.g., Is asking for a specific transaction amount compliant for AAL2?").
2.Verification: The module retrieves relevant clauses from the NIST PDF and parses the AAL Requirements chart to determine legality.
3.Decision: The officer receives a Pass or Fail recommendation with a clickable citation to the specific policy section, enabling them to approve the question for the live system.

## 3) Success metrics
### Product / impact metrics (required)
- Time-to-decision: Reduce the time to verify a new security question from minutes (manual PDF search) to < 2 seconds.
- Trust/verification signals: Grounding Score (100% match between the AI's verdict and the actual NIST document text/table).
- Adoption/usage signal: Reduction in account lockouts by 40% (due to deploying better, compliant questions)

### Technical metrics (recommended)
- Quality (e.g., accuracy/F1, Precision@K/Recall@K, calibration, etc.): Distractor Plausibility (Cosine Similarity > 0.8 between the correct answer and generated distractors to ensure difficulty).
- Latency: Average query processing time < 3 seconds.
- Failure rate: Rate of Hallucinated compliance advice (Target: 0%)

## 4) Failure & risk (what happens if wrong?)
- Likely failure: The OCR model might misinterpret complex flowchart logic in the AAL tables during high traffic, causing the system to retrieve incorrect or incomplete compliance requirements.
- Impact: Auditors could approve non-compliant security questions, leading to potential regulatory fines and increased fraud risk if weak authentication methods are deployed.
- Mitigation: Implement a Human-in-the-Loop review step for all OCR-derived citations and enforce a strict caching policy to reuse verified table parses rather than regenerating them for every query.

## 5) Next sprint plan
- Next feature: Develop an Agentic Workflow using LangGraph that allows the system to autonomously query Snowflake for live transaction data to build dynamic verification questions.
- Data improvement: Expand the knowledge base to include more diverse banking policy documents (e.g., FCRA, BSA) to broaden the auditor's compliance coverage beyond just NIST 800-63B.
- Evaluation improvement: Integrate an automated Red Teaming suite to systematically probe the system with adversarial prompts and measure its refusal robustness against jailbreak attempts.
